Fake API Integration
PRIMEPICK fetches product data using a fake API to simulate real-world data fetching. The API returns product lists, details, and other necessary information without requiring a backend.

Products API: Simulates product data such as titles, images, and prices.
The API is designed to mimic real-world API calls but is powered by mock data for front-end demonstration purposes.

PRIMEPICK includes a simulated user authentication system using  "Clerk Authentication" . Although there is no actual backend, the following features are available:

Registration: Users can register with a username and password (stored temporarily in state).
Browse Products: Users can view a list of products fetched from the fake API.
Add to Cart: Users can add products to their cart, adjust quantities, or remove items.
Checkout: Users can proceed to a simulated checkout page where they fill in shipping details.
